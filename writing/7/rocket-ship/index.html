<p>Write about a Rocket Ship on its way to the moon or a distant galaxy.</p>

<hr />

<p>A rocket ship on its way to the moon or a distant galaxy. Isn’t that similar to what we are all doing? I feel like I’m currently on a rocket ship going to a distant galaxy as well. It’s like we were born here on Earth but there wasn’t much that we could do to find similarities between what was actually home versus if we were actually going to a distant galaxy.</p>

<p>The distant galaxy is representative of us returning back home. It’s all a pattern. A pattern that reveals to us exactly what we are.</p>

<p>The rocket ship represents the journey from our minds to our hearts and our hearts to our minds. The inner emptiness that we find when going from one place to another, we realize that it’s the emptiness that we’re actually in love with or is that we create.</p>

<p>There is nothing about having or owning something that gives us satisfaction. It’s the mystery, the unknown that we actually yearn for.
 It’s the emptiness of life, the mystery of the “distant galaxy” that keeps the spirit/curiosity alive within us. And as long as the curiosity or faith that we have in our hearts is still wide awake, we can do whatever we will. And that is where happiness and joy stems from.</p>

<p>It is when we hit a wall and find the labels around us that we start to get into trouble. The rocket ship is not an adventure, rather it is a coming home to our natural state. The distant galaxy is not somewhere far away, it is a reminder of where we first began.</p>

<p>In life, our consciousness only knows 1. Either we’re on the rocket ship going through the galaxy or we aren’t. When we remember who we are, the rocket ship is revealed, when we strive to be on the rocket ship, then that’s a different story.</p>
