<p>Write something inspired by a recent dream you had.</p>

<hr />

<p>The dream that I remember is about a mini reunion that my high school friends and I had. We had a good time, but I felt like I was disconnected from them.</p>

<p>It’s like when I found myself. I disconnected from others but when I had found myself, then I try to connect with others. But at the end of it all, it comes down to being comfortable with yourself. That is all that we strive to do. All that we really should be striving to be.</p>

<p>An honest indication, a true reflection of who we are to ourselves and by doing so that will translate into our personality and who we are to others.</p>

<p>Dreams I think are such beautiful things. There is no other creature in the world that dreams besides man. Dreams opens up gates into our subconscious that has stained and blocked our full consciousness.</p>

<p>Each of us either has a fulfilled dream that we are meaning to accomplish or we have a certain experience we want to shut down. In either case, dreams are our true selves communicating with us, what it is that we need to do to get to that good place.</p>

<p>It is all a nothingness. All the end goals of humanity comes down to a nothingness that we have. It’s a beautiful thing. It isn’t glamorous or it won’t give you more riches, but it will give you clarity. It will transform you to purify and clean your eyes to admire the eternal.</p>

<p>It is by no means an easy nor fast process. But when the journey towards nothingness has begun, there is no turning back.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the joy and love that I have received in this day. I understand that it is during those times we don’t want to do things that need to get done, is when we actually really need to do them.</p>

<p>May we all be granted and give the same amount of love from today until the end of our lives.</p>
