<p>How do you feel when you love someone who does not love you back?</p>

<hr />

<p>I really don’t mind it. Because I love myself, when I know that I deeply love myself, there isn’t anyone in the world that I know that can make me feel bad.</p>

<p>Because I am the universe, I am the ocean. Perhaps not as vast or expansive as the actual thing. But I hold the vastness of the universe and the depths of the ocean inside me.</p>

<p>In the dark silence, I can hear the fishes fly out to me, within me. The richness of all that is natural, nature itself, the woods, the trees, the pines.
The secret of the world I hold within me.</p>

<p>I am awake. For those awake, a deep responsibility is needed, because there is risk involved.</p>

<p>With deeper awareness, there is a deeper responsibility, with deep responsibility is required a deep trust. With this deep trust, there is even a bigger risk.</p>

<p>That is why whatsoever you do, go and see it through. Only then are you able to collect the benefits of what you sow.</p>

<p>May the ones that have the ears to listen &amp; may all the ones that have the heart, understand.</p>

<p>As I shine the light within me, other flames do I touch and light theirs as well.</p>

<p>If I’m going to write anything about love, let it be this. That the ultimate love is the love of non-attachment to others. That you have only yourself. Only need yourself.</p>

<p>I think of a large oak tree as a symbol of the enlightened. Others are birds &amp; animals alongside you that enjoy your shade &amp; resources.</p>

<p>This wanting to become the oak tree, comes down to understanding that this whole thing was first just a small seed. Many people understand the oak tree.
Many people reap the benefits of the oak tree, but few are the ones that help the seed to grow.</p>

<p>That are nurtured that way.</p>

<p>I had a realization of my dad. I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for the hard work he’s put in to allow me to be here writing right now.</p>

<p>I can feel his love &amp; compassion through my blood &amp; veins. It is ingrained within me. It has mixed with the mysteries of the universe. The love of one’s parents. How beautiful.</p>

<p>I’m a poet. I don’t write based off of logic. I write based out of my heart, my own voice. The voices in my head are still there. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to shut them up. Writing does help centralize them down to one voice, but they still won’t shut up.</p>

<p>My time for today is over. I will continue this practice to love, the inner, the immortal. Ever expanding &amp; ever dying. It’s the introduction of the paradox that fights a heavy war within me.</p>

<p>As I extend my writing to a new page, it awes me that this level of pressure can be relieved so easily by the pinpointing of the pen.</p>

<p>It feels like I’m murdering my own inner self &amp; tattooing each corpse onto the paper.</p>

<p>Death itself keeps you close to reality. There’s a bit of satisfaction I get from it. The silent violence is full in my pen.</p>
