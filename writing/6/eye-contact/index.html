<p>Write about 2 people seeing each other for the first time.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two people staring at each other for the first time. I suppose if both of them had the courage to stare at one another in the eye, there is a level of courage and interest that both feel for the other.</p>

<p>A staring of the eyes is a deep dive into the spirit. A soul is most visible through the eyes. A man may have a name, a many may have a house, a certain status or position. But the one thing a man can never truly lie behind is his eyes. In the eyes, one sees almost everything that a person goes through if they understand enough. In the eyes, all are bare, there is no place to hide.</p>

<p>In the eyes, the scariest things a person goes through gets revealed. But also, the most beautiful thing a person has gone through can be shared with the eyes as well.</p>

<p>In the eyes, you can get a glimpse of all that is hidden within the person. One that has seen too much sometimes is thought of something out of the ordinary, but they are the ones that have gone through the beyond. Many have gone crazy, but a few wise ones seem crazy, but they are really wise. Itâ€™s fine distinction between the two and a pure heart is needed to be able to see clearly.</p>

<p>It is the ones that have bravely ventured out to the unknown, the ones with the mystical eyes that have ever made any changes in history really.</p>
