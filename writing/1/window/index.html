<h2 id="day-1-outside-the-window">Day 1: Outside the Window</h2>

<p>What’s the weather outside your window doing right now?<br />
If that’s not inspiring, what’s the weather like somewhere you wish you could be?</p>

<hr />

<p>The weather outside is currently cloudy. It was raining earlier, but now it’s actually fine. I’m thinking I should learn a new vocabulary word every single day. That way I can improve my writing &amp; insert all sorts of imagination into my work.</p>

<p>Let’s begin and define “my work”  and the consciousness that I just recently had by acknowledging myself in my writing. I’ve only written one paragraph, but my mind has already traveled to many places. Is that a sickness? Or a gift? Maybe both intertwined together by prejudices of society by what we perceive is correct or not, is logical or not. What a trip.</p>

<p>Who are these voices in my head? Scrambling around talking over each other. I don’t even know my own voice anymore, lost in the chaos, in the dark mess. But to me, there’s a sort of melody I can hear.</p>

<p>They say there is power in words, there is power in the pen. But I don’t see power. I see a boy looking to find peace. Hmm. Is this why people write? To reveal another level of consciousness that they have onto the paper? It’s both addicting and frightening.</p>

<p>I had to look up a synonym for scary, which was frightening. And just like that, I lost my stream of consciousness. What a fragile thing this human mind is.</p>

<p>And to think that this roller coaster of consciousness came through writing about the weather.</p>

<p>How is the weather anyhow? The heat from my heater that I feel on my left ribcage is quite pleasant in this chilly room.</p>

<p>I love the smell of the wood from this table. I love the classical music playing in the background. I love how natural all of these words are being painted onto the paper. It’s like my voice is finally free, the ironic thing is that I haven’t even spoken a word since I picked up this pen.</p>

<p>The relief! And to realize the only thing I needed was a silly topic, a timer, pen &amp; paper.</p>

<p>This post is not about the weather at all. This prose was about giving myself the opportunity to write, to build, to start.</p>
