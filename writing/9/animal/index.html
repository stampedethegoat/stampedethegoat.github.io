<p>Choose an Animal. Write about it!</p>

<hr />

<p>I choose a turtle today for my animal to write about. The turtle is a wise figure, a wise animal. I don’t think it’s been considered as a joke or a silly animal ever in the history that I’ve read books and stories. Maybe TNMT is the one that might be different, but even that they’re more like teenage boys that they are turtles.</p>

<p>Turtles teach us to slow down a bit. To see that as fast as the world is growing, we need to maintain a slow clarity always. A favored and slow paced but consistent marching towards our end goal. Turtles don’t march in crowds, which should teach us something.</p>

<p>I chose to write about turtles today as a gentle reminder of what we need. A sturdy hard shell to guard our inner selves and a slow marching towards what we want. And in due time, we will get there.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I thought the turtle was a slow, old persons’ pet. Now that I’m a bit older, I’m a bit more balanced and the turtle teaches me quite a lot. I strive to be a bit more like the turtle. Independent, majestic, and slow paced. It’s a beautiful creature.</p>

<p>It’s during the times that I have so many thoughts racing towards me that I need to realize more of the philosophy of the turtle.</p>

<p>Focusing on one thing at a time definitely has its power somewhere. Making the most of each minute, living fully with each breath. It’s what we all actually need more in our lives.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter how fast or slow you’re going. A minute is universal to everyone. Ironically, only by realizing that the need of focus like the turtle is actually how you get further and further to places.</p>

<p>Think on it.</p>
