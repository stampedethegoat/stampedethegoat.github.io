<p>Who’s dancing and why are they tapping those toes?</p>

<hr />

<p>CJ is dancing because he’s at a competition this weekend. He’s tapping those toes because that’s his hobby, that’s what he enjoys doing. As others enjoy different things, dancers love to dance.</p>

<p>In a sense, are we not all dancing in one form or another. Whether it is dancing in our actions, in a simple dialogue that we have with one another.</p>

<p>In our day to day life, dancing is just an art expression of how our bodies play with the rhythms of the universe. It’s a way of channeling our innermost selves to the vibrations of others.</p>

<p>In my own dance, I am slowly writing poetry and sparking inspiration in everyday life, regardless or not what the outcome looks like.</p>

<p>The dancers that are great are the ones that move with a certain grace, a certain flow. They’re the ones that have completely separated their mindset. It looks like they are not dancing, but rather the universe is channeling it’s energies through them. They themselves have died, so there is room for the universe to dance through them.</p>

<p>I am grateful, tough I might not always remember it, I know that being here in the present now, I am able to practice my grace &amp; be part of the dance with the universe.</p>

<p>May I always remind myself that I am able to flow with the universe as best as I can, with every single person that I meet.</p>

<p>I’m grateful that every single morning I am able to become the person that I strive to be. That every single day, I have another opportunity to wake up &amp; just be.</p>

<p>I have a heavy task, but I am ready to march forward. Giving my best every single day.</p>

<p>Being patient &amp; understanding to others &amp; to flow in the universe.</p>

<p>So dancing, dancing with all of its beautiful movements. It’s quite good exercise too. Both body and mind being one with the moment, it is an essential goal for humanity to start dissolving &amp; believing in the new.</p>
