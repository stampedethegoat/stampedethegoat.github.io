<h2 id="day-5-what-s-for-breakfast">Day 5: What’s for Breakfast</h2>

<p>What’s for breakfast? Dinner? Lunch? Or maybe you could write a poem about that time you met a friend in that cafe.</p>

<hr />

<p>I had an omelet today for breakfast with toast, then I added a banana as the fruit after I was done eating &amp; had me some old brew after I was done.</p>

<p>I was very satisfied with my food. With just a little effort, I had a breakfast like a king!
 Will one ever be too tiresome for my words? My message? I constantly ask myself that. I think about what else I need to think about or come up with to keep my writing fresh &amp; exciting. It sounds like the passion of youth.</p>

<p>There’s another voice telling me to let that youth inside die so that the true man can come to life.</p>

<p>Yes, that is what needs to happen. There is no audience I am trying to entertain, there is no person I am trying to impress. There is only me and when I have realized (noticed I didn’t use the word “found”) myself, the fake journey ends and the true one begins.</p>

<p>Thank you for the realizations, the constant reminders triggered by my voices, I know the true one is there somewhere. He is, and I am too full of clouds. I must remind myself that I &amp; the eternal sky are one, there needs to be a certain level of clarity there.</p>

<p>As my teacher says, simply dissolve away the clouds &amp; then you will begin to see the true sky, the true nature of your being.</p>

<p>And to think this post was about to be about food. Perhaps not the daily physical food, but my true food. The one that is inconceivable, my true food that comes from the unknown.</p>

<p>This spiritual food is a realization, an enlightened moment that comes naturally. At first, only a mustard seed, as small as a mustard seed &amp; now a huge tree with branches that span 100 feet. Branches!</p>

<p>We are blessed not to live in 2018 in the modern day, but to live at all. Away with those thoughts! There is no evil or good in your thoughts. The thoughts themselves are the clouds of what you truly are, your soul nature.</p>

<p>Your soul &amp; your love is needed to enter this space. To enter this spiritual food.</p>

<p>This spiritual food will turn the ordinary to the extraordinary. I can speak about the wonders of this food, but I cannot make you taste it or eat it.</p>

<p>I can spurn your imagination on what it is about, the food, the forbidden fruit!</p>

<p>There is no fruit, there is no forbidden. Once you break the chains of the past, you will start to understand &amp; know that you, reader are the person of the future.</p>

<p>It’s not a matter of convincing or changing your ways. It’s a matter of dissolving &amp; destroying who you actually are. Enrich yourselves not with the worldly but acknowledge and know your true self.</p>

<p>The world has many reasons to tell you that you are a certain way. This, that, yes, no. May the ones that are giving &amp; loving to others be a source of comfort to the ones that do not even have the bravery to question. The first will be last &amp; the last will be first. Realize this &amp; you are on your way.</p>

<p>I have a beloved friend ask me that one one has taken the red pill and regrets it. He then told me that he is afraid of how far the rabbit hole goes.</p>

<p>My simple response was that there is no red pill, no blue pill. There is no rabbit hole. All this is how far to tip off the edge. How far you make it your own.
 Simply drop all ideas, all expectations, all necessity to be a nothing &amp; see life for what it truly is. A nothingness that we experience.</p>

<p>A beautiful blissful nothingness that comes with cities filled with all kinds of people, all kinds of beauty. Enjoy it! Do not seclude yourself from the experiences this world has shown you, but go forth &amp; be!</p>
