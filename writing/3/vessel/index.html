<h2 id="day-3-the-vessel">Day 3: The Vessel</h2>

<p>Write about a ship or other vehicle that can take you somewhere different from where you are right now.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Tesla Model 3 is one of the sickest cars that I’ve ever been into. With the self drive capability, the simplistic and minimalist style, that’s what I want right there. Midnight black.</p>

<p>As much as I appreciate the car that I have right now, it still gives me a worrisome mindset sometimes.</p>

<p>Is my ink running out? It’s always the case that more fancier pens just don’t last very long. Maybe I’m not using it correctly.</p>

<p>Back to the car though, my dad’s always been a huge fan of cars, but I think it gets to him. Which is okay, &amp; I hope he realizes the futility of it. I guess that’s just how it goes.</p>

<p>I suppose the idea of transforming yourself from one place to another is something ingrained since the beginning of the universe.</p>

<p>Sea creatures like fish adapted fins to swim faster or according to the necessity of their consciousness. Mother nature is unlike us though, there isn’t a time frame for her, no deadline to meet, no bugs to troubleshoot.</p>

<p>And these bugs eventually get destroyed off by mother nature. There is no mercy for those creatures, but mother nature doesn’t see it that way. She sees it as a necessity, that a death can be something quite beautiful actually.</p>

<p>Life &amp; death, birth &amp; rebirth. The cycle continues, but there are certain things stay constant. Our job is to gently remind each other of that, to remind ourselves that it is the definition that we give ourselves in this world that truly matters, regardless of what others think.</p>

<p>The realization that we don’t need much really, but the state of peace within our own minds. Our whole being craves this, but we put up walls because we’ve been hurt by what’s happened to us.</p>

<p>There is a sort of death in our minds that needs to happen, that the evolution of mankind lies and stagnates our growth in order to create more money and more things, but what we actually need is to create more death within us.</p>

<p>By truly going through the fires of purification, we know that the true essence of life starts to reveal itself.</p>

<p>Today is the first day of a brand new month and the last month of this year. I am grateful to see the amount of growth that I’ve had since the last year.
May all the energies of the universe guide me towards sanity &amp; peace, to rest for all those who come to me. May I continue to be known as one that has forever given up the all to attain the essential.</p>
